# Goal the project

The project aims to build a frontend app implementing dictionaries and validating it.

# How to run the project

`git clone https://github.com/Sakai-san/dictionary`

`cd TO_FOLDER`

`npm i`

`npm run start`

# Side remarks to the project

## Timeframe

I had a limited time I could dedicate to the project due to some freelance work.

## Persistence

Data changes persist in `localStorage`.

## Unit test

Code related to Inconsistencies in dictionary has been tested.

## Typing

I usually prefer TS over Flow. But for pure dev project, Flow is a bit more straightforward.

## Overall

Nice project. Takes quite a while if you d like to implement all required features properly.

Indeed I did not time to implement creation of new dictionaries through the UI. However you can edit the file `dictionaries.json` on that purpose.
